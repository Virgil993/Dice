Notes regarding diseration aspects:

Security notes:

1. Configuring the VPC's:
    - Create a VPC with appropriate CIDR block.
    - A CIDR block is a method for allocating IP addresses in the VPC.
    - Have two availability zones for high availability.
    - Each availability zone should have a public, private and isolated subnet.
    - When accesing S3 from the EC2 instances, use the VPC endpoint for S3 to avoid going through the internet.
    - Enable DNS Resolution to allow the EC2 instances to resolve extenral domain names like redis or RDS.
    - Enable DNS Hostnames to allow the EC2 instances to have public DNS names so the health checks from the load balancer can work correctly.
    - Create isolated subnets for the RDS instance to ensure that it is not accessible from the internet.
    - Asign the newly created isolated subnets to a route table that does not have a route to the internet gateway.
    - Create an isolated subnet for the RDS instance to ensure that it is not accessible from the internet.

1.1 Security Group Considerations:
    - Create a security group for the application load balancer that allows incoming traffic on port 80 and 443.
    - Create a security group for the EC2 instances that allows incoming traffic from the application load balancer on port 80 and 443.
    - Create a security group for the RDS instance that allows incoming traffic from the EC2 instances on port 3306.
    - create a security group bastion host that allows incoming traffic from the internet on port 22 for SSH access.
    - Use Network ACLs to control traffic to and from the subnets.
    - Use VPC Flow Logs to monitor traffic in and out of the VPC.


2. Considerations when choosing a CIDR Block:
    - Avoid public IP addresses in the CIDR block.
    - Avoid using the same CIDR block as other VPCs.
    - Ensure no overlap between public, private and isolated subnets.


3. AWS RDS:
    - Use MYSQL for the database.
    - Use the latest version of MYSQL.
    - Use Multi-AZ deployments for high availability.
    - Use memory optimized instances because the application writes messages to the database frequently. This way, we take advantage of the in-memory caching.
    - Create a master user with admin privileges.
    - store the credentials in AWS Secrets Manager.
    - Block public access to the RDS instance.
    - Connect to the database using SSL.
    - Create a new database user with limited privileges for the application.
    - Store the new database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager.
    - Use Database Insights Advanced Monitoring to monitor the database performance.
    - Export Audit, Error, General and Slow Query logs to CloudWatch for analysis.
    - Use Password and IAM database authentication for connecting to database.
    - Use Dualstack (IPv4 and IPv6) for the database.

4. Choosing Between An application load balancer and an API Gateway:
    - Use an application load balancer if you need to route traffic to multiple services or if you need to perform SSL termination.
    - Use an API Gateway if you need to create a RESTful API or if you need to perform request/response transformations.
    - Use an application load balancer if you need to support WebSockets or HTTP/2.
    - Use an API Gateway if you need to support OAuth 2.0 or if you need to create a usage plan for your API.

5. Steps to set up the architecthure:
    - Create a VPC with a public, private and isolated subnets.
    - Create a security group for the application load balancer that allows incoming traffic on port 80 and 443.
    - Create a security group for the EC2 instances that allows incoming traffic from the application load balancer on port 80 and 443.
    - Create a security group for the RDS instance that allows incoming traffic from the EC2 instances on port 3306.
    - Create a security group for the S3 bucket that allows incoming traffic from the EC2 instances on port 80 and 443.
    - Create the application load balancer and associate it with the public subnet.
    - Create the EC2 instances and associate them with the private subnet.
    - Create the RDS instance and associate it with the isolated subnet.
    - Create the S3 bucket and make it so that it is accesible only from the EC2 instances.
    - Create the IAM role for app management and policies for access to S3, RDS and secrets manager.
    - Create Instance profiles for the EC2 instances to allow them to access the S3 bucket and RDS instance.
    - Deploy the frontend to CloudFront and set up WAF rules to protect the application from common web exploits.

6. Backend Considerations
    - use cors
    - use helmet
    - use rate limiting for auth
    - soft delete data to ensure that data is not lost.
    - validate data before inserting it into the database.
    - use PASETO tokens for authentication and authorization.

7. What to hold in secrets manager:
    - Database credentials
    - SMTP server credentials
    - Secret signing key for active_session, verify_email_session and password_reset_session.
    - rotate the session signing keys every 30 days.

8. Secrets Manager Considerations:
    - Create a custom key in KMS for the secrets manager for encryption
    - Replicate the secrets manager to multiple regions for high availability.
    - Use both IAM roles and policies to control access to the secrets manager and the Resource Permissions Manger from the Secrets manager to have a fine-grained access control.

9. KMS (Key Management Service) Considerations:
    - Use a custom key for the database credentials in the secrets manager.
    - Use o custom key for the SMTP server credentials in the secrets manager.
    - use a custom key for the secret signing keys in the secrets manager.

10. For Local Development:
    - Create an IAM user with limited privileges for local development.
    - Add all the policies from the IAM role for app usage to the IAM user.
    - Use the IAM user credentials to access the AWS resources from local development.

11. S3 Considerations:
    - Disable public access to the S3 bucket.
    - Use server-side encryption for the S3 bucket.
    - Use versioning for the S3 bucket.

12. Sessions:
    - mitigate XSS by setting a strong content security policy.
    - decided to use local storage for the session tokens because we have cross origin requests which means we need to set the cookie SameSite=None and Secure=True. 
    However, this is still not enough because the cookie can still be stolen by a malicious site with https that makes a request to our backend.

13. Nodemailer:
    - use Nodemailer for sending emails.
    - authenticate using OAuth2 with gmail.

14. RateLimiting:
    - use rate limiting for the auth endpoints to prevent brute force attacks.
    - use a sliding window algorithm for rate limiting.
    - use Redis for storing the rate limiting data.
    - Use AWS ElastiCache for Redis for high availability and scalability.
